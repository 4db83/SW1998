# SW1998
Stock and Watson (1998) Replication files. 
This runs on Matlab version R2023a with the following toolboxes installed.

MATLAB                                                Version 9.14        (R2023a)
Econometrics Toolbox                                  Version 6.2         (R2023a)
Optimization Toolbox                                  Version 9.5         (R2023a)
Parallel Computing Toolbox                            Version 7.8         (R2023a)
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox               Version 12.5        (R2023a)
Symbolic Math Toolbox   

PS. The Parallel Computing & Symbolic Math Toolbox are not needed. Most likely it is only the 
Optimization Toolbox that is required. 

Zip download or clone the SW1998 directory to your local machine. 
Then, simply run the "SW1998_MUE_replication.m" by pressing F5 (or the run button), and it should work.
Let me know if there any problems.
